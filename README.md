CS 405 (Computer Graphics): Texture + Illumination Project
This repository contains my implementation of the CS 405 Project 2: Texture + Illumination, focusing on enhancing the rendering pipeline for 3D models. The project involves creating a web-based interface to upload and visualize 3D model meshes with texture and illumination effects, completed through the following tasks:

Task 1: Modified the setTexture method to support images of any size as textures, allowing seamless rendering beyond the initial constraint of power-of-two dimensions.
Task 2: Implemented basic lighting, including ambient and diffuse light, to illuminate 3D scenes dynamically. Enabled light manipulation via sliders for ambient density and arrow keys for directional adjustments.
Task 3: Added specular lighting based on the Phong reflection model, introducing realistic highlights and a dynamic slider to control specular intensity.
Task 4: Extended functionality to support and blend multiple textures for complex material simulations, enriching the visual detail of rendered objects.
This project demonstrates skills in JavaScript, WebGL, and shader programming to create interactive and visually compelling 3D graphics. All modifications were made exclusively in project2.js as per the assignment's guidelines.
